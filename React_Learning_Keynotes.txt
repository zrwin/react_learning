	Data types: 
	
	Primitive(immutable): NNSSBU (Null,Number,STring,symbol,Boolean,Undefined)
			 and non-primitive(mutable): Objects,Arrays
		Primitive types can be compared based on value
		ex:- let a =5; 
			let b= 5;
			(a==b)  // true		

		
	Key point: Immutable in the sense that when let x=5, x=10 , so basically x is	
		pointing to a different address in the memory but 5 is still present 
		in the memory and becomes part of the garbage collection and that memory
		is reused depending upon the program management.

	Non-primitive types can't be compared based on values
	let nums = [1, 2, 3]
	let numbers = [1, 2, 3]

	console.log(nums == numbers)  // false	

	Non-primitive values are referred to as reference types, because they are 
	being compared by reference instead of value. 
	Two objects are only strictly equal if they refer to the same underlying object.

	let nums = [1, 2, 3]
	let numbers = nums

	console.log(nums == numbers)  // true

	

Arrays: 	
	An array is a collection of different data types which are ordered and
	 changeable(modifiable). 
	An array allows storing duplicate elements and different data types. 
	An array can be empty, or it may have different data type values.
